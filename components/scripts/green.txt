Serene voyager unbound by perpetuated chasm,
the trial of times forgotten can only one bear.
So... what brings you to Midoritierra?
...
Excuse my unmannerliness... I have yet to introduce myself.
I am the sorcerer of these plains,
maintainer of peace and order,
caster of the breeze of tranquility,
wielder of the infinite gr√∂n magic.
And my friends call me G.
