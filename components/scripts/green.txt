 Serene voyager unbound by perpetuated chasm  the trial of times forgotten can only one bear.
 So... what brings you to Midoritierra?

 Excuse my unmannerliness... for I have yet to introduce myself.
 I am the sourcerer of these plains
 maintainer of peace and order
 caster of the breeze of tranquility
 wielder of the inifinte gr√∂n magic.
 And my friends call me G.
