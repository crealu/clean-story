Serene voyager unbound by perpetuated chasm,
the trial of times forgotten can only one bear.
So... what brings you to Aotierra?
...
Excuse my unmannerliness... I have yet to introduce myself.
I am the sorcerer of these seas,
maintainer of peace and order,
caster of the wave of elegance,
wielder of the infinite bloah magic.
And my friends call me Buccarati.

OLLLLD
!?
Oh, where could it have gone ??
I put it right here next to my staff!
... MY STAFF!
Oh grehn shards! Did I misplace that, too, now?
What a terrible way to start the day - all out of sorts.
Wait.. perhaps Buccarati hid it.. always playing tricks on me.
I oughta teach that sorcerer a lesson!
If I could only find that triangular hat first..

My hat!
Thank you so much for finding it.
Here, I will open the portal to Akatierra.
