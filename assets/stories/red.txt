Serene voyager unbound by perpetuated chasm,
the trial of times forgotten can only one bear.
So... what brings you to Akatierra?
...
Excuse my unmannerliness... I have yet to introduce myself.
I am the sorcerer of these volcanic slopes,
maintainer of peace and order,
caster of the flame of avidity,
wielder of the infinite rehd magic.
And my friends call me R.
