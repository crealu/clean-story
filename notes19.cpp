// linked list is a data structure that consists of small containers that
// are linked together by pointers

// containers are classes, each class in a linked list holds one object of
// your data and knows how to point to the next

// one cnontainer is creatd for each object and they are chained together

// linked containers are called nodes
// their order: head node, internal node, tail node

// linked lists come in three funcamental forms
//    1. singly linked
//    2. doubly linked
//    3. trees

// 1. singly linked - each node points the next one forward, but not backward,
//                    starting from the top

// 2. doubly linked - enables you to move backward and forward to the next node
//                    and previous node

// 3. trees - a complex structure of nodes that can point in two or three directions

// linkedlist.cpp demonstrates an object oriented approach to link lists,
// particularly a singly linked list
// three primary clases exist in the program: Data, Node, LinkedList
